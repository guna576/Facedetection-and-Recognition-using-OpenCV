Face detection can be regarded as a specific case of object-class detection. In object-class detection, the task is to find the locations and sizes of all objects in an image that belong to a given class. Examples include upper torsos, pedestrians, and cars.

Face-detection algorithms focus on the detection of frontal human faces. It is analogous to image detection in which the image of a person is matched bit by bit. 
Image matches with the image stores in database. 
Any facial feature changes in the database will invalidate the matching process.[3]

A reliable face-detection approach based on the genetic algorithm and the eigen-face[4] technique:

Firstly, the possible human eye regions are detected by testing all the valley regions in the gray-level image. Then the genetic algorithm is used to generate
all the possible face regions which include the eyebrows, the iris, the nostril and the mouth corners.
